# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview

My app is a Project-Task Time Tracker.
Users can use this browser-based tracker to track projects and associated tasks.
A task can have detailed description, and a project can have many tasks.
Users can also track the time spent on each task, by manually entering the start
and end times, or by clicking on a start / end button to use the automatic timer.
Users can modify details of the task description at any time.

Users can run reports on time spent on all tasks in a project or on all of the
user's tasks. Accounts receivables departments can use those reports to bill
clients for time spent on the tasks. 

### Features

Maintain projects & tasks entries: Users can create, update, delete & view projects
and tasks.

Time entries: Enter time spent on tasks.

Report on total time spent by user, by project, by month, or a combination thereof.

### Technologies

ASP.NET Core
MySQL
Bootstrap
JavaScript to implement automatic timer, to postback to server (AJAX?) without a
form submission, and / or persistence on client-side until user hits a submit button.

### What I'll Have to Learn

To implement the automatic timer, I will need to learn how to keep track of the
running time when the user hits the start / stop timer buttons either with a
round-trip back to the server, or a persisting on client-side until user hits a
separate Submit button

To implement the automatic timer, I will need to learn to display a running timer
and a stopped timer.
